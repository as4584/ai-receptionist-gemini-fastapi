feat: Implement comprehensive offline evaluation system for haircut assistant

This commit establishes a complete evaluation framework for testing the 
conversational intelligence of the haircut appointment booking assistant 
through 7 critical scenarios, ensuring robust offline testing without 
external API dependencies.

## Key Features Added:

### 🧠 Conversational Intelligence Scenarios
- **Ambiguous datetime requests**: Tests clarification handling for vague time references
- **After-hours booking attempts**: Validates business hours enforcement and alternatives
- **Missing service type requests**: Tests service clarification and information gathering
- **Double booking conflicts**: Tests conflict detection and alternative time proposals
- **Cancel appointment flows**: Tests cancellation request handling and confirmation
- **Reschedule appointment flows**: Tests appointment modification with dual datetime tracking
- **Payment security rejection**: Tests sensitive information detection and security warnings

### 📁 Infrastructure Components
- **EVAL_SYSTEM_README.md**: Comprehensive documentation with usage instructions and architecture overview
- **docs/samples/haircut_*.json**: 7 new JSON fixtures following standardized schema with realistic dialogue flows
- **tests/test_eval_blueprint.py**: Extended with 7 new pytest functions enforcing confirmation-before-booking patterns
- **pytest.ini**: Enhanced configuration for deterministic offline testing with TEST_MODE environment
- **.github/workflows/test.yml**: Updated CI workflow supporting Python 3.11-3.12 with comprehensive eval verification

### 🔒 Security & Compliance Features
- **Payment information rejection**: Automatic detection and refusal of credit card data
- **PAN number protection**: Ensures sensitive payment details never appear in conversation logs
- **Security warning messages**: Professional guidance toward secure payment processing

### ✅ Quality Assurance Requirements
- **Confirmation-before-booking**: All booking actions require explicit user confirmation
- **Complete information gathering**: Required fields (name, service, datetime) validated before tool calls
- **Professional response patterns**: Business-appropriate tone and error handling
- **Conversation flow integrity**: Natural dialogue progression with context awareness
- **Offline-first architecture**: Zero network dependencies for deterministic testing

## Technical Implementation:

### SOLID Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Validation helpers centralized with no duplicated confirmation logic
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core logic uses simulation interfaces rather than external APIs
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible fixture pattern allows easy addition of new evaluation scenarios

### Test Coverage Metrics
- 20 total test functions (13 existing + 7 new evaluation scenarios)
- 100% offline execution with deterministic JSON fixture validation
- Comprehensive business logic testing including conflict detection and security handling
- Multi-action support testing (book/cancel/reschedule appointment flows)

### Business Logic Validation
- **Business hours compliance**: Monday-Friday 9 AM-6 PM, Saturday 9 AM-4 PM, Sunday closed
- **Service type support**: haircut, styling, trim, haircut and beard trim
- **Conflict resolution**: Automatic alternative time suggestions with user choice confirmation
- **Data validation**: ISO datetime format consistency and required field enforcement

## Verification:

All tests pass locally with pytest -v:
```
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_ambiguous_time_flow PASSED
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_after_hours_flow PASSED  
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_missing_service_flow PASSED
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_conflict_propose_alt_flow PASSED
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_cancel_flow PASSED
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_reschedule_flow PASSED
tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_payment_refusal_flow PASSED
```

## Usage:
```bash
# Run complete evaluation suite
pytest -v

# Test specific scenario
pytest tests/test_eval_blueprint.py::test_haircut_ambiguous_time_flow -v

# Quick validation
pytest -q
```

This implementation provides a production-ready evaluation system for 
conversational AI testing with comprehensive scenario coverage, security 
compliance, and maintainable architecture following software engineering 
best practices.
