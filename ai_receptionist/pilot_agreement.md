# Pilot Agreement (30-Day Trial)

Thank you for piloting our AI Receptionist. This short agreement outlines the 30‑day pilot, billing, KPIs, number porting/forwarding, and cancellation.

## Term
- Length: 30 days starting on the Pilot Start Date.
- Scope: One primary phone number, standard business hours coverage, and agreed services.

## Billing (Card on File)
- Card on file is required prior to activation.
- Pilot pricing: either (a) flat pilot fee, or (b) metered minutes at agreed rates.
- Invoices: billed to the card on file at the end of the pilot or monthly, whichever comes first.

## KPIs Tracked
- Answer rate (% of inbound calls answered by AI/human).
- Booking conversion (% of qualified calls that result in booked appointments).
- Average Speed to Answer (ASA) and escalation rate.
- Optional: Customer satisfaction (CSAT/NPS) if enabled.

## Number Porting & Forwarding
- Recommended: temporary forwarding from your current number to our service number for the pilot.
- Porting (if required) occurs only after successful pilot and written approval.
- Caller ID and SMS handling will be discussed and configured as needed.

## Data & Access
- Minimal access required: calendar credentials (scoped), business hours, services, and escalation contacts.
- Data used only to provide the service and improve performance per your settings.

## Cancellation & Conversion
- Cancel anytime during the 30‑day pilot with written notice; service stops within 2 business days.
- If you continue after 30 days, the account converts to the selected plan (Starter/Core/Pro/Enterprise).
- Upon cancellation, numbers are unlinked (no porting without prior approval); all access tokens are revoked.

## Acceptance
