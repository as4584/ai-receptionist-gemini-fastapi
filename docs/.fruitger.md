# Copilot Design Contract — Frutiger Aero UI System

Copilot must follow these rules when generating UI, CSS, JSX, SVG, or animation code.

## 🌈 Aesthetic Rules (Frutiger Aero)
- Use bright aqua, neon green, sky blue, and white gradients.
- Prefer glossy, wet, plastic, or gel-like UI surfaces.
- Use chrome reflections, curved highlights, and bubble aesthetics.
- Include soft drop shadows, blur, glow, and glassmorphism.
- Favor early-2000s futurism vibes: playful, bubbly, optimistic.
- Prefer rounded shapes: buttons, cards, borders (10–32px radius).
- Use oversaturated landscapes, sky imagery, bubbles, or abstract shapes in backgrounds.

## 🌐 Layout
- Clean, centered, modern layout.
- Large glossy hero section.
- Bold typography with soft highlights.
- Plenty of breathing room (generous padding).

## 🔄 Animations
