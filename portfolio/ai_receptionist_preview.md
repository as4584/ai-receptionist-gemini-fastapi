# AI Receptionist Page Redesign

I have successfully redesigned the **AI Receptionist** page to match the Frutiger Aero aesthetic.

## 1. ROI Calculator
The calculator is now housed in a large **Aero Glass** container.
- **Inputs**: Glossy, semi-transparent fields that glow on focus.
- **Results**: Vibrant, gradient text for the savings amount.
- **Layout**: Clean, two-column grid for inputs and results.

## 2. Pricing Section
The pricing cards have been transformed into **Glass Cards**.
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift up slightly on hover.
- **Core Plan**: Highlighted with a neon border and "Most Popular" badge.
- **Typography**: Clean, modern fonts with Aero colors.

## 3. Hero & Demo
- **Hero**: Features the "Never Miss Revenue" title in the Aero style.
- **Live Demo**: A glass panel simulating a chat/call interaction.

The entire page is now consistent with the homepage's design language.

## Next Steps
- **Review**: Check the screenshots above.
- **Functionality**: The calculator logic has been preserved and should work as before.
- **Finalize**: If you're happy with this page, we can move on to any other pages or wrap up the project.
