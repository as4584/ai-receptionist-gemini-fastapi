# Technical Audit & Preview Report

## 1. Visual Preview
The **Fluid Dew** theme is fully implemented and verified.

### Desktop View
- **Hero Section**: Displays the "Wet Glass" effect and glowing typography against the fluid cyan-blue gradient.
- **Footer Section**: Confirmed seamless scrolling with no dark blocks. The gradient and bubbles extend to the very bottom.

## 2. Technical Audit Findings

### ✅ Code Quality
- **Clean HTML**: All inline styles (`style="..."`) have been removed from `index.html`. The structure is purely semantic.
- **Maintainable CSS**: No `!important` tags were found in the stylesheets, ensuring a clean cascade and easy future updates.
- **Separation of Concerns**: `global.css` handles the theme (colors, gradients, animations), while `style.css` handles layout and responsiveness.

### ✅ Mobile Responsiveness
- **iPhone Optimized**: The CSS includes specific `env(safe-area-inset-...)` variables to handle notches and dynamic islands.
- **Touch Friendly**: Interactive elements (buttons, links) have a minimum height of **44px** to meet mobile accessibility standards.
- **Fluid Layout**: Media queries ensure content stacks vertically on screens smaller than 768px.

### ✅ Performance
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Animations (bubbles, floating particles) use `transform` and `opacity` for 60fps performance.
- **Optimized Scrolling**: The background is set to `fixed`, preventing expensive repaints during scrolling.

### ✅ Bug Fixes
- **Scroll Background**: The issue where dark blocks covered the background on scroll has been resolved by setting section backgrounds to `transparent`.
- **Contrast**: Text contrast has been maximized (White + Glow) to ensure readability on the deep blue background.

## 3. Next Steps
- The site is ready for deployment or further content addition.
- Consider adding a "Contact Form" backend integration (currently it's a frontend form).
