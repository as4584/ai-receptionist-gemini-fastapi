# Bright Frutiger Aero Theme Update

I have completely overhauled the theme to match the **Bright Nature** aesthetic you requested (Sky, Grass, Water).

## 1. Global "Nature" Wallpaper
- **Background**: A vibrant CSS gradient that simulates a horizon:
    - **Top**: Sky Blue (`#87CEEB`) fading to Clouds (`#E0F7FA`).
    - **Middle**: Lawn Green (`#7CFC00`) strip for the "grass" horizon.
    - **Bottom**: Deep Sky Blue (`#00BFFF`) fading to Sea Blue (`#006994`) for the underwater view.
- **Sun Glare**: Added a CSS-based sun glare in the top right corner for that classic lens flare feel.

## 2. Milky Glass Containers
- **Glass Effect**: Updated `.aero-glass` to use a **Milky White** semi-transparent background (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65)`) with a white border. This ensures content "hovers" distinctively above the colorful background.

## 3. High Contrast Typography
- **Text Color**: Switched from White to **Dark Teal** (`#004d40`) and **Sea Green** (`#00695c`). This provides excellent contrast against the white glass containers and fits the "nature" palette perfectly.
- **Titles**: Kept the 'Orbitron' font but applied a dark teal gradient to match the new theme.

The site now looks like a classic 2000s Frutiger Aero desktop—bright, optimistic, and full of depth.
