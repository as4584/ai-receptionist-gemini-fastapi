# Contrast & Color Fixes

I have addressed the issues with text visibility and the "purple" background.

## 1. Removed Purple
- **Background**: Updated the global gradient to a **True Deep Blue** (`#002b5e` to `#0059b3`). This removes the purple hue from the previous "Deep Indigo" color.

## 2. High Contrast Text
- **Section Titles**: All section titles (e.g., "Projects That Started...", "Hey, I'm Lex") are now **White** with a subtle blue glow for maximum readability.
- **Subtitles**: Updated to **Lime Green** (`#76ff03`) to pop against the blue background.
- **Body Text**: Forced all paragraph text to be **White** or **Light Cyan** (`#e0f7fa`), removing any dark grey text that was hard to see.

The site now has a clean, high-contrast look that is consistent with the "Lime Green Soda" theme and free of purple tones.
