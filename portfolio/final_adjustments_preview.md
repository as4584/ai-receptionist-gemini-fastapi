# Final Design Adjustments

I have implemented the final set of tweaks you requested to perfect the aesthetic.

## 1. Removed Hero Image
- **Action**: Deleted the profile photo container from the Hero section.
- **Result**: The hero section is now cleaner and purely text-focused, allowing the "Lex Santiago" title to take center stage against the fluid background.

## 2. Slowed Bubble Animation
- **Action**: Increased the animation duration from `25s` to **`60s`**.
- **Result**: The bubbles now float upwards in a very slow, relaxing, and almost hypnotic motion, matching the "chill" vibe of the fluid theme.

## 3. Lime Green Titles
- **Action**: Changed the color of all `.section-title` elements to **Lime Green** (`#76ff03`).
- **Result**: The titles now pop vibrantly against the deep blue background, matching the "still learning, always building" accent text perfectly.

The site is now fully aligned with your vision: fluid, high-quality, and perfectly colored.
