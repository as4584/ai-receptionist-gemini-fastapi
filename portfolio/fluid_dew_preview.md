# Fluid Dew Theme - Scroll Fix

I have removed the conflicting background styles that were appearing when scrolling down.

## Fixes Implemented
- **Removed Dark Blocks**: The `.blog`, `.contact`, and `.footer` sections in `style.css` previously had solid dark backgrounds (`#120a2e`). I have set these to `transparent`.
- **Consistent Gradient**: The **Fluid Cyan-to-Blue Gradient** now extends seamlessly from the top to the bottom of the page.
- **Bubbles Preserved**: The animated bubbles remain visible over the entire height of the page.

The site now maintains the premium "Fluid Dew" aesthetic 100% of the time, regardless of scroll position.
