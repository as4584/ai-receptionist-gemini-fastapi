# Frutiger Aero Refinement: Phase 4 Complete

I have refined the **Projects** and **About** sections to align with the Frutiger Aero aesthetic.

## 1. Centered Projects Grid
The project cards are now perfectly centered, creating a balanced look for your 2 current projects.

## 2. Aero Widgets (Tech Stack)
The tech skills have been transformed into **Aero Widgets**:
- **Glossy Squares**: Each skill is a glass-like tile.
- **Hover Effects**: They scale up and glow on hover.
- **Vibrant Icons**: The emojis pop against the glass background.

## Status
- **Hero**: Complete (Phase 3)
- **Projects**: Refined & Centered (Phase 4)
- **About**: Refined with Widgets (Phase 4)
- **Contact/Footer**: Complete (Phase 4)

The entire homepage is now fully redesigned in the Frutiger Aero style.

## Next Steps
- **Final Review**: Check the screenshots above.
- **Deployment**: Since you are running locally, you are good to go!
- **Optional**: If you want to add more pages (like a dedicated "About" page or "Blog"), we can do that. Otherwise, the redesign is complete.
