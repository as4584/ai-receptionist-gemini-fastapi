# Wallpaper & Hover Effect Update

I have implemented the "Animated Wallpaper" and "Hovering Content" effect on the Home Page.

## 1. Global Wallpaper
- **Background**: The entire site now uses the **Deep Blue + Floating Bubbles** animation as the fixed background.
- **Removed**: The scanline overlay and section-specific backgrounds have been removed to let the wallpaper shine through.

## 2. Hovering Content
- **Hero Section**: The main hero content is now wrapped in a transparent container that allows the bubbles to be seen clearly behind it.
- **Portfolio & About**: These sections also float above the background, maintaining the depth and "Frutiger Aero" feel.

The site now feels like a cohesive, 3D space with content floating in a "Lime Green Soda" aquarium.
